<h1>City of Trees</h1> 




<h2>Description </h2>
<p1>City of Trees is a music festival based in Sacramento, CA presented by the radio station, Alt 94.7. During the music, I served as a photographer for various artists including Bastille, Odesza, Chvrches, and more. I captured moments from their interview with the radio stationâ€™s on-air talents, and shot the meet and greet photos with the artists and the listeners after their interview.</p1>
