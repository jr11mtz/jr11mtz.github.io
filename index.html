<h1>City of Trees</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
  <p2>City of Trees is a music festival based in Sacramento, CA presented by the radio station, Alt 94.7. During the music, I served as a photographer for various artists including Bastille, Odesza, Chvrches, and more. I captured moments from their interview with the radio stationâ€™s on-air talents, and shot the meet and greet photos with the artists and the listeners after their interview</p2>
