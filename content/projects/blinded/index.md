<p>This short film was created to critique biased news and gender discrimination across news media. A creative team of three and myself collaborated in researching discriminatory news broadcast and created a narrative that highlighted oppressions in media. I also served as a videographer for the film and focused on creating the entire shot list for the short</p>
